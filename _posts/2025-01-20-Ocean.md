# Water in modern games

<hr>

How do modern games render water, I always asked myself? In this blog post I am going to explain the deep secrets of how big studios render water in detail. There are a lot of aspects and ways to make use of water so to make it a little simpler to follow I am going to focus on oceans in specific. 

So let's start at the beginning by looking at a couple implementations of games that make great use of an ocean.

# The big question is how can we achieve this?

<hr>

There are 2 major components that we need to create a realistic looking ocean the first component is a oceanographic spectra and the second component is a fast Fourier transform which I will explain later on in this post.
