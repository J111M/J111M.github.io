# Water in modern games

<hr>
How do modern games render water, I always asked myself? In this blog post I am going to explain the deep secrets of how big studios render water in detail. There are a lot of aspects and ways to make use of water so to make it a little simpler to follow I am going to focus on oceans in specific. 

So let's start at the beginning by looking at a couple implementations of games that make great use of an ocean.

# The big question is how can we achieve this?

## Setup
There are 2 major components that we need to create a realistic looking ocean the first component is an oceanographic spectra and the second component is the fast Fourier transform which I will explain later on in this post.

So what is this Oceanographic spectra? It is formula that simulates ocean waves under certain conditions, these waves are produced by different wind speeds over big areas. Luckily for us we don't have to get the data from these ocean ourselves since other people did the work for us. I decided to use the [JONSWAP](https://www.codecogs.com/library/engineering/fluid_mechanics/waves/spectra/jonswap.php) (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectrum for my implementation since it has a lot of artistical control and is based of accurate data of the north sea.

## IFFT
The second component we need is the fast Fourier transform which is an algorithm that efficiently computes the DFT(discrete Fourier transform). The DFT coverts
