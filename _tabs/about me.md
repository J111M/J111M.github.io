Hi, my name is Jim van der Heijden. I am a third-year **C++ Graphics programmer** at **Breda University of Applied Sciences**. Since I was young, I always had a passion for playing and making games. I really like researching how some of these big games and engines work from the inside.

I have been programming for about 7 years now, first starting off in Unity C# and now working in C++ on custom tech or with Unreal Engine.

Things I like to do outside of school
- Traveling around the world and exploring cool places 🌍
- Working out 4-5 times a week at the gym 💪
- Playing games, with my favorites being Elden Ring and the Zelda series 🎮
- Working on personal projects in my free time 💻
